# ðŸ˜· Real-Time Face Mask Detector using CNN
## This project is a real-time face mask detector that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or no mask via webcam feed. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and deployed using OpenCV to make real-time predictions.

# ðŸ“Œ Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV

- CNN-based mask classification

- Webcam integration for live inference

- Visual bounding boxes with labels ("Mask"/"No Mask")
